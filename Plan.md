Axioms <br>
Let X(t)_i be a stochastic process representing individual i of n individuals.<br>
Let each X(t)_i be determined by an undeterminable process, with certain repeating patterns being recognizable and determinable.<br>
A group of X(t)_i's with similar repeating patterns is called a society.<br>

A society gains more value, the more members there is in the group. Even if the value function has a deminishing returns property.<br>
ESFJ, ISFJ, ISTJ, ... Are all the "front line ants", INTJ, INFJ, ... Are all the "back line ants". <br>
Societies are competitive. There's competition within a society, for positions. <br>
Women go by beauty, sociability then skill. Men go by skill, sociability then beauty.
