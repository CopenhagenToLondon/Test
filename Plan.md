Axioms <br>
Let X(t)_i be a stochastic process representing individual i of n individuals.<br>
Let each X(t)_i be determined by an undeterminable process, with certain repeating patterns being recognizable and determinable.<br>
A group of X(t)_i's with similar repeating patterns is called a society.<br>

A society gains more value, the more members there is in the group. Even if the value function has a deminishing returns property.<br>
ESFJ, ISFJ, ISTJ, ... Are all the "front line ants", INTJ, INFJ, ... Are all the "back line ants". <br>
Societies are competitive. There's competition within a society, for positions. <br>
Women go by beauty, sociability then skill. Men go by skill, sociability then beauty.

The goal of each X(t)_i is to conserve as much energy as possible, the goal for each society is to conserve as much energy as possible within the society. <br>
If one of the X(t)_i's within the society has a conservation goal, that goes against the general society conservation goal. The society will try to change this.

# Side Quest - TMRW

Objective: To earn money by running a successful algorithmic investment fund.

Learned Axioms.
1. Markets are fractal, but with unknown and shifting dimensionality
2. Markets have different states, but they are continuous, rather than discreet.
3. The price movements in a market can be understood as a mean field game. Being affected by many different forces
   a. Participant sentiment
   b. Fundamental value
   c. mean reversive effects
